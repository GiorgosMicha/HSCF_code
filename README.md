Notebooks for obtaining density profiles in polytropic stars and calculating other physical parameters.
The codes are the base of the Izumi's Hachisu algorithm. They were developed during my Bachelor thesis in order to solve the algorithm analytically and obtain structures of rapidly rotating polytropic stars.
